    "\n",
    "The Department of City Planning (DCP) maintains a geocoding application called Geosupport Desktop Edition that you can download and use to query and geocode addresses, BBLs, or BINs. It can be found at the following link: http://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/dwn-gde-home.page. They also have an online interface version that lets you query addresses one-by-one: http://a030-goat.nyc.gov/goat/Default.aspx.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, the Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications (DoITT) has built a Geoclient API that allows you to query the geocoding service without having to download and install the desktop edition. In order to use this API, you must first register for an account and request an API key. This can be done at the following link: https://developer.cityofnewyork.us/api/geoclient-api. \n",
    "\n",
    "To make things easier, John Krauss wrote Python bindings for DoITTâ€™s Geoclient API that allows for easy querying using Python. To install this package, from the command line >>> pip install nyc_geoclient.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition for this tutorial we will be using pandas, so if you haven't already, install that as well. >>> pip install pandas.\n",
