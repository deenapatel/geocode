    "[Presentation on geocoding](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LyM9f6icWiee1HE5ai_H73_IZ4C65YAzX52cR-flifo/edit?usp=sharing)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Department of City Planning (DCP) maintains the official NYC geocoding application called GeoSupport. There are multiple ways of accessing this application. A web interface ([GOAT](http://a030-goat.nyc.gov/goat/Default.aspx.)) lets you query addresses one-by-one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way of accessing the online version of GeoSupport is through and API maintained by the Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications (DoITT). In order to use this API, you need to [register for an account and request an API key.](https://developer.cityofnewyork.us/api/geoclient-api) For now you can use the keys provided here.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make things easier, [John Krauss](https://github.com/talos/nyc-geoclient) wrote Python bindings for DoITTâ€™s Geoclient API that allows for querying using Python. Documentation here: [nyc_geoclient](https://nyc-geoclient.readthedocs.io/en/latest/geoclient.html). \n",
